# Portfolio Viz Dashboard

* Data fetched from Alpha Vantage API.
* Created in the `ReactJS` framework, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This turned out to be a hilariously poor choice of frameworks, but oh well.
* Charts: `plotly.js` as the best middle ground between `Charts.js` (easy to plug-and-play, difficult to customize due to insufficient documentation) and `D3.js (v5)` (*not* easy to plug-and-play, but endless customization possibilities.)
* Made pretty with just CSS.
